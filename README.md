# Finderr-Property-Finder-Wesbsite
This is a project I recently created when learning to implement React Js. Its a simple property vendor front-end only site that makes use of certain different JS libraries such as SwiperJS, Accordion JS, Countup library etc. 

The project is also resposive to multiple different screen types, and for this I make use of Css media queries. The website comes with a consistant Purple-White theme with shades of orange, blue and red. I use content embedded within the site out of a youtube tutorial from a channel known ZAINKEEPSCODE

I finally publish the website as a page on the CloudFlare Platform for free hosting : https://finderr-property-finding-website.pages.dev/
